        Block Packs allow users to create custom blocks that others can use

        everyone, you must adhere to these guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Accurate Descriptions:</strong> Misrepresenting what a block
          does or providing false information in a Block Pack's description will
          result in penalties.{" "}
          <em>
            Private packs do not require accurate descriptions, but all packs
            must still follow the guidelines listed here.
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Harmful Content Prohibition:</strong> Hosting any Block Pack
          or project designed to harm DisFuse, external platforms, users, or
          mislead others is prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enforcement and Penalties:</strong> Violations may result in
          warnings or penalties. Repeat offenses can lead to temporary or
          permanent bans from DisFuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Respect:</strong> Ensure that your Block Packs
          respect the community guidelines and do not infringe upon the rights
          of others.
